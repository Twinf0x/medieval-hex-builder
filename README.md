# Hexagon-Hamlet
Build up a brand new town on Hex Island and earn tons of gold!

In Hexagon Hamlet you try to earn as much gold as possible while building up a colony on the far away shores of Hex Island.
Just pick one of your available blueprints and construct the building anywhere on the island. Afterwards you can go ahead and
collect taxes from Hex Island's inhabitants. Whenever you earned enough gold you can buy new blueprints!
And so the circle begins anew. If only those greedy architects wouldn't charge more and more...
